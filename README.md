# Coursera: Princeton Algorithms 

Self learning of Princeton University's Algorithms course in Coursera.

Instructors: Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne

Textbook: [Algorithms, 4th][algs4]

Websites: [Algorithms, part I][part1], [Algorithms, part II][part2]

## Assignments

### Project 0: Hello, World

Implementations of class *HelloWorld* and class *HelloGoodbye* are uncessary import *algs4.jar*.   
Thus, CLI use *javac* and *java* instead of *javac-algs4* and *java-algs4*.   
**Note**: Knuthâ€™s method, when reading *i*th word which *i* is start from 1, not 0.

### Project 1: Percolation

In class *Percolation*, method *open()* should not open site repeated times.
If you get a more larger value, check your open() method whether it open site multiply times
and count the repeated times.


## Schedule

Week 1-6 is from [part I][part1], rest week is from [part II][part2].   
Interview Questions are optional, you should write it if you want a job.
Every week has an assignment which requires all content of that week and previous weeks.
